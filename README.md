# Simple python _app_ to **get a job!** :)

Usage: 

```./monitor.py -h```

File sites.csv contains a pre-selection of urls and patterns to be monitored

Feel free to play with it!

Default timeout is set to 0.2 sec so we can see both: sites that are 
[] able 
[] unable 
to respond

**Cheers to BLS guys!**
